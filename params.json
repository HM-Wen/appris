{"name":"Appris","tagline":"Annotating principal splice isoforms","body":"Welcome to APPRIS - A system for annotating alternative splice isoforms\r\n=======================================================================\r\nAPPRIS [1] is a system that deploys a range of computational methods to provide value to the annotations of the human genome. APPRIS also selects one of the CDS for each gene as the principal isoform.\r\n\r\nAPPRIS defines the principal variant by combining protein structural and functional information and information from the conservation of related species.\r\n\r\nThe server has been used in the context of the scale up of the GENCODE (http://www.gencodegenes.org/, a sub-project of the ENCODE) project to annotate the Human genome but APPRIS is being used for other species:\r\n  * Human\r\n  * Mouse\r\n  * Rat\r\n  * Zebrafish\r\n\r\n\r\nSystem overview\r\n===============\r\nThe goals of the APPRIS system are to annotate alternative variants with reliable biological data and to select the primary variant for each gene. APPRIS is based on a range of complementary computational methods.\r\n\r\nThe methods in APPRIS are the following:\r\n  == Functionally important residues, firestar\r\n  == Protein structural information, Matador3D\r\n  == Presence of whole protein domains, SPADE\r\n  == Conservation against vertebrates, CORSAIR\r\n  == Presence of whole trans-membrane helices, THUMP\r\n  == Prediction of signal peptide and sub-cellular location, CRASH\r\n  == Selective pressure evolution of exons, INERTIA [Note: Currently, this method is not affecting in the selection of the principal isoform]\r\n\r\n\r\nData access\r\n===========\r\nThe APPRIS websites offer an export option, suitable for small amounts of data. This is the ideal option if you want a protein sequence as a FASTA file, or a JSON/GTF file of a few features of a gene or transcript. Furthermore, you can get annotation tracks of gene/transcripts in the BED format. Simply click on one of the \"Export\" links in the right menu, and select the output options. If you wish to extract multiple features, we recommend the following alternatives.\r\n\r\n== Web Services, APPRIS data can be returned remotely using web services.\r\n  http://apprisws.bioinfo.cnio.es/\r\n\r\n== Downloads, APPRIS data text files.\r\n  http://appris.bioinfo.cnio.es/#/downloads\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n==========\r\n[1] Rodriguez JM, Maietta P, Ezkurdia I, Pietrelli A, Wesselink JJ, Lopez G, Valencia A, Tress ML.\r\nAPPRIS: annotation of principal and alternative splice isoforms. \r\nNucleic Acids Res. 2013 Jan;41(Database issue):D110-7.\r\n\r\n\r\nContact\r\n=======\r\nThis APPRIS website is powered by the Structural Computational Biology Group at\r\n\tCentro Nacional de Investigaciones Oncologicas, (CNIO, http://www.cnio.es)\r\n\t\tand\r\n\tInstituto Nacional de Bioinformatica, (INB, http://www.inab.org)\r\n\r\nIf you have questions or comments, please write to:\r\n\tJose Manuel Rodr√≠guez, jmrodriguez@cnio.es\r\n\tMichael Tress, mtress@cnio.es.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
