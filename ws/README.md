# APPRIS System

APPRIS (http://appris.bioinfo.cnio.es) is a system that deploys a range of computational methods to provide value to the annotations of the human genome.
APPRIS also selects one of the CDS for each gene as the principal isoform.

# RESTful Web Services

The APPRIS allows manipulation of the database/server data through various RESTful web services.
There are services that retrieve useful information of genes/transcripts, and services that retrieve the results of the execution of APPRIS methods.
