    <p class="indent1">
	This track hub contains the peptides that were identified by <a href="http://proteomics.cancer.gov/programs/cptacnetwork" target="_blank">Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC)</a>
	in their deep mass spectrometry based characterization of the proteome content of breast, 
	colorectal and ovarian cancer biospecimens that were initially sequenced by <a href="http://cancergenome.nih.gov/" target="_blank">The Cancer Genome Atlas</a>.
	Please, address questions to info@fenyolab.org.
	</p>
    <p class="indent1">
	Global proteome measurements were performed on all tumor types to provide quantitative information on protein concentrations. For breast and ovarian tumors,
	quantitative measurements were also done on the phosphoproteome to provide more detailed information on cell signaling.
	</p>
	
    <p><b>Display Conventions and Configuration</b></p>
    <p class="indent1">
	The tracks are colored according to the cancer awareness ribbon colors: all cancers - lavender, colorectal - brown, breast - pink, and ovarian - teal.
	The quantitative information shown is the spectral count of the peptide. 
	</p>
	
    <p><b>Methods</b></p>
    <p class="indent1">
	Frozen tumor pieces were obtained from TCGA and cryopulverized. Proteins were reduced, alkylated and subjected to trypsin digestion. 
	Peptides separated using an off-line high pH (7.5 or 10) reversed-phase chromatography followed by low pH reversed-phase chromatography
	in-line with Thermo Fisher Q-Exactive (breast and ovarian tumors) or Orbitrap Velos (colorectal tumors) mass spectrometers. 
	For the colorectal tumors, the quantitation was done using label-free quantitation (spectral counting and area under the curve). 
	4-plex iTRAQ labeling was used for the ovarian and breast tumors: 3 tumor samples and internal control was mixed and analyzed together.
	For breast and ovarian tumors the sample were split between global proteomics analysis and phosphoproteomic analysis. For the phosphoproteomic 
	analysis, phosphopeptides were enriched using immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC).
