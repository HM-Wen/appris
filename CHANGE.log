# TODO LIST	or DECLARATIONS OF INTENTIONS #
###########################################

* APPRIS-CODE,
	- APPRIS # TODO!!!
		- Create a cutoff for the decision of CORSAIR. If the longest isoform is bigger than 1000aa, then we don't
		take into account CORSAIR score.
		- New weight for CORSAIR.    

	- SPADE # TODO!!! (NOT USED YET: IN TEST)
		- Normalized lengths for each DOMAIN, plus template gap penalties.

	- THUMP  # TODO: 2!!!
		- There is a bug in the consensus... check the example, PDE3B, ENSMUSG00000098306
		- Implement CACHED method. Take into account temporal files that are cached.
	
	- CRASH # TODO!!!
		- Execute SignalP sequence by sequence because the program crashed for more than 3 sequences.

	- MATADOR3D # TODO!!!
		- Algorithm as CORSAIR. Create non-redundant PDB database.
		
	- FIRESTAR # TODO????? (ask Michael)
		- Take into account the median of sites to final decision in appris-firestar.
		
	- INERTIA # TODO!!!!
		- RUN in CALENDULA.FCSC.ES THE DIFF GENES of GENCODEM4 - GENCODE19 - GENCODE22 !!!
		
	- Include INERTIA annotations for Human (only Gencode19) and Mouse (GencodeM4).

	- Think about create new STRUCTURE of Data:
		- Concatenate the methods files for each gene...
		- Concatenate the results for each gene in one file??? Whats happen when you execute appris for some methods?
		
	- APPRIS # TODO!!!
		- Rename "scripts/apprisall.pl" script to "scripts/appris.pl" 
		- Create "apprisall" script that executes the pipeline, checks the results and insert the annotations.
		- Include INERTIA changes (for Gencode19)
				
	- INERTIA # TODO!!!!!!
		- Include annotations for Human (Gencode19) and Mouse (GencodeM4). For Mouse we only used "compara" alignments.
		NOTE: Be careful, the Human results come from Gencode12 and the Mouse results come from GencodeM2

	- (main) APPRIS
		- Modify the way to obtain the inputs
			- Type of inputs: 
				- directory data (cached)
				- gencode data
				- ensembl data
				- sequence (protein) data
			- Type of alignment:
				- compara
		- Delete runner files				

		- Add INERTIA script

		- New cutoff of 1.5
		- Include the list of species for 'Danio rerio'
	
	- MATADOR3D
		- The gene ENSG00000160404 is rejecting ENST00000373284 with an negative alignment -0.20125 because

		We have modify the threshold of percentages of gaps to:
		
				elsif ($gaps > 25)
					{ $totalgaps = 0 }
				elsif ($gaps > 33)
					{ $totalgaps = -0.5 }
				elsif ($gaps > 40)
				
		- Take the correct transcript		
		- Change the threshold of Matador3D to 0.65

	- APPRIS
		- Reliability scores:
			If transcript is UNKOWN, its reliability score is NR (not rejected).
			And if the transcript has the longest protein sequences, its reliability score is NR*
			
			Only the transcripts with PRICIPAL have reliability scores.
		- If we don't have information of codons, we continue saving the appris score.

	- THUMP		
		- Changes the regular expresion to parse transcript for any kind of identifier.

#########################

* APPRIS-WEBSITE, v1.3

- Links of archives redirect to more specific website.

- Rename the suffix of data files of 'rattus_norvegicus'.

- Change the annotations of SPADE and THUMP. Now, we print their "scores" in the website:
	- SPADE shows an float number where the absolute number is the pfam domains that are detected. Then, the number after the decimal indicates the numbers of partial domains.
	- THUMP shows the number of TMH detected. Again, the number after the decimal indicates the partial TMH.
 
- Delete the phrase "on Human (GRCh37/hg19) Assembly" from the 'report' web page.

- Fix the URL that retrieves proteomics data as BED format.

- Update the proteomic data (gencode12):
	- Peptides were assembled from five previously available proteomics data sets. Three of the peptide data sets came from published large-scale experiments (Ezkurdia, Nagaraj, Geiger) 
	and the others were from two large spectra libraries, PeptideAtlas (Farrah) and NIST (http://peptide.nist.gov/).
	These tracks show where peptide evidence exists (0 or 1) , but there is no means of scoring these tracks.

# DATE: 	25Jul2013   #
# RELEASE:  3.1         #
#########################


* MAIN DESCRIPTION:


* APPRIS-CODE, v1.1

We have decided to establish new nomenclature of version of appris's code.

	- SPADE does not migrate domains of variants with the same sequence where pfamscan does not provide results. 
		For example, ENSG00000021300.7 (Gencode15)
		
	- FIRESTAR prints results whose cutoff is smaller than 65%. This is bad!!! 
	For example, ENSG00000184361 (Gencode15)

	- CORSAIR, has new scores of the rest of species (including Lynx pardinus):
		'Rest of species'
			'Homo sapiens'				=> 1,
			'Pan troglodytes'			=> 1,
			'Mus musculus'				=> 1.1,
			'Rattus norvegicus'			=> 1.1,
			'Bos taurus'				=> 1.2,
			'Canis lupus familiaris'	=> 1.2,
			'Sus scrofa'				=> 1.2,
			'Monodelphis domestica'		=> 1.3,
			'Gallus gallus'				=> 2,
			'Taeniopygia guttata'		=> 2,
			'Anolis carolinensis'		=> 2,
			'Xenopus tropicalis'		=> 2.2,
			'Tetraodon nigroviridis'	=> 2,
			'Danio rerio'				=> 2.5,

* APPRIS-DATA:

- Human
	> Gencode12, rel12.27Jun2013.v5

		- FIRESTAR printed results whose cutoff was smaller than 65%.

* NEW GENOMES:

- Mouse
	> Ensembl70, e70.v3.15Jul2013
		- SPADE did not migrate variant domains with the same sequence.		
		- FIRESTAR printed results whose cutoff was smaller than 65%.

- Rat
	> Ensembl70, e70.v3.10Jul2013
		- SPADE did not migrate variant domains with the same sequence.		
		- FIRESTAR printed results whose cutoff was smaller than 65%.


* APPRIS-WEBSITE, v1.3
	
	- Add script for the rest of species
